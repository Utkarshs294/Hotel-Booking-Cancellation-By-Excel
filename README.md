# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-By-Excel

Hello everyone !!

I'm excited to share my latest Hotel booking cancellation project by Excel✨✨

Objective :-

The objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior in making hotel reservation and identify factors that impact the cancellation rate of reservation .📉📊

Tools used :- Microsoft Excel

Insights :-

- For the resort hotel ,a total of 27.76% Booking were cancelled and for city hotel and total of 41.73% booking were cancelled.

- August month is most occupied with booking at the hotel.

- The highest Average Daily Rate (ADR) has occurred in August and due to the highest ADR in August ,maybe it could be one of the reason for more of cancellation in August.

- As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort than the city hotels.
