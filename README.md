# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-By-Excel

I'm excited to share my latest Hotel booking cancellation project by Excel.

Objective :-

The objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior in making hotel reservation and identify factors that impact the cancellation rate of reservation.

Tools used :- Microsoft Excel

Steps :-

- Data Cleaning:- Ensured the data was free of errors, inconsistencies, and duplicate.
- Data Processing: - Prepared the data for analysis by organizing and formatting it appropriately.
- Data Analysis: - Use various analytical techniques to drive insights and draw meaningful conclusion.
- Data Visualization: - Present the findings through charts and graphs.

Insights :-

- For the resort hotel ,a total of 27.76% Booking were cancelled and for city hotel and total of 41.73% booking were cancelled.
- August month is most occupied with booking at the hotel.
- The highest Average Daily Rate (ADR) has occurred in August and due to the highest ADR in August ,maybe it could be one of the reason for more of cancellation in August.
- As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort than the city hotels.
